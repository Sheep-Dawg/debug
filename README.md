JS
error 1 a semi colon instead of an ending parentheses
error 2 there was no variable. so i created one
error 3 its calling greeting as a function when it is instead a variabe so they should use console.log(greeting) instead
error 4 had let obj = a property with the name of property
error 5 needed to acces the user properties individually like so console.log("User infor:" + " " + user.name + " " + user.age);
error 6 since num = "10" it was treating it like a string ad putting it next to the five. by setting num = 10 it becomes a number again and they add together.
